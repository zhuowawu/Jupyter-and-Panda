# School_District_Analysis
The analysis on school district data using pandas in JupyterBook.

## Overview of the school district analysis
In this project, we used the pandas dependency of Python to do analysis on School district data. We analyzed students' reading and math scores in correlation to their grades, funding, school size and types. In our final analysis, we took out the reading and math scores of the 9th graders in Thomas High School and re-analyzed all of the above conditions.

## Results
### How is the district summary affected?
From the analysis result as follows, removing the test results of the 9th graders at Thomas High School did not change much of the district summary.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing the 9th graders' math and reading scores did not change Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools as it stayed at the second place in the district.

## Summary
Overall, replacing the ninth-grade scores had no effect on any of the categories analyzed, possibly due to its small sample size and all the scores being within a reasonable and medium range.
